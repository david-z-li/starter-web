Ac 1:1The former account I have made, O Theophilus, concerning all the things that Jesus began both to do and to teach,

Ac 1:2Until the day on which He was taken up, after He had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom He chose;

Ac 1:3To whom also He presented Himself alive after His suffering by many irrefutable proofs, appearing to them through a period of forty days and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God.

Ac 1:4And as He met together with them, He charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, He said, You heard from Me;

Ac 1:5For John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now.

Ac 1:6So the ones who came together asked Him, saying, Lord, are You at this time restoring the kingdom to Israel?

Ac 1:7But He said to them, It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set by His own authority.

Ac 1:8But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

Ac 1:9And when He had said these things, while they were looking on, He was lifted up, and a cloud took Him away from their sight.

Ac 1:10And while they were looking intently into heaven as He went, behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them,

Ac 1:11Who also said, Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you beheld Him going into heaven.

Ac 1:12Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away.

Ac 1:13And when they entered, they went up to the upper room where they were residing, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the brother of James.

Ac 1:14These all continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.

Ac 1:15And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers and said (there was a group of persons gathered together, about a hundred and twenty),

Ac 1:16Men, brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who seized Jesus;

Ac 1:17For he was numbered among us and was allotted his portion of this ministry.

Ac 1:18(Now this man acquired a piece of land with the wages of unrighteousness; and falling headlong, he burst in the middle, and all his inward parts gushed out.

Ac 1:19And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem, so that that piece of land was called in their own dialect, Akeldamach, that is, Field of Blood.)

Ac 1:20For it is written in the book of Psalms, “Let his habitation become desolate, and let no one dwell in it”; and, “His overseership let another take.”

Ac 1:21It is necessary therefore that of the men who accompanied us all the time in which the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,

Ac 1:22Beginning from the baptism of John until the day on which He was taken up from us, one of these should become a witness of His resurrection with us.

Ac 1:23And they proposed two, Joseph, called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.

Ac 1:24And they prayed and said, You Lord, Knower of the hearts of all, show us clearly the one whom You have chosen of these two

Ac 1:25To take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.

Ac 1:26And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was counted with the eleven apostles.

Ac 2:1And as the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled, they were all together in the same place.

Ac 2:2And suddenly there was a sound out of heaven, as of a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.

Ac 2:3And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, which were distributed; and it sat on each one of them;

Ac 2:4And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues, even as the Spirit gave to them to speak forth.

Ac 2:5Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.

Ac 2:6And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together and was confounded because each one heard them speaking in his own dialect.

Ac 2:7And they were amazed and marveled, saying, Behold, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?

Ac 2:8And how is it that we each hear them in our own dialect in which we were born?

Ac 2:9Parthians and Medes and Elamites and those dwelling in Mesopotamia, both in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,

Ac 2:10Both in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya around Cyrene, and the sojourning of Rome, both Jews and proselytes,

Ac 2:11Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the magnificent works of God?

Ac 2:12And they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, What does this mean?

Ac 2:13But others jeered and said, They are full of new wine!

Ac 2:14But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth to them: Men of Judea, and all who are dwelling in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words.

Ac 2:15For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is the third hour of the day;

Ac 2:16But this is what is spoken through the prophet Joel:

Ac 2:17“And it shall be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream things in dreams;

Ac 2:18And indeed upon My slaves, both men and women, I will pour out of My Spirit in those days, and they shall prophesy.

Ac 2:19And I will show wonders in heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and vapor of smoke.

Ac 2:20The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord comes.

Ac 2:21And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”

Ac 2:22Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man shown by God to you to be approved by works of power and wonders and signs, which God did through Him in your midst, even as you yourselves know —

Ac 2:23This man, delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to a cross and killed;

Ac 2:24Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it.

Ac 2:25For David says regarding Him, “I saw the Lord continually before me, because He is on my right hand, that I may not be shaken.

Ac 2:26Therefore my heart was made glad and my tongue exulted; moreover, also my flesh will rest in hope,

Ac 2:27Because You will not abandon my soul to Hades, nor will You permit Your Holy One to see corruption.

Ac 2:28You have made known to me the ways of life; You will make me full of gladness with Your presence.”

Ac 2:29Men, brothers, I can say to you plainly concerning the patriarch David that he both deceased and was buried, and his tomb is among us until this day.

Ac 2:30Therefore, being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him to seat One from the fruit of his loins upon his throne,

Ac 2:31He, seeing this beforehand, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was He abandoned to Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption.

Ac 2:32This Jesus God has raised up, of which we all are witnesses.

Ac 2:33Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He has poured out this which you both see and hear.

Ac 2:34For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, “The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand

Ac 2:35Until I set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet.”

Ac 2:36Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified.

Ac 2:37And when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, What should we do, brothers?

Ac 2:38And Peter said to them, Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

Ac 2:39For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God calls to Himself.

Ac 2:40And with many other words he solemnly testified and exhorted them, saying, Be saved from this crooked generation.

Ac 2:41Those then who received his word were baptized, and there were added on that day about three thousand souls.

Ac 2:42And they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.

Ac 2:43And fear was upon every soul; and many wonders and signs took place through the apostles.

Ac 2:44And all those who believed were together and had all things common;

Ac 2:45And they sold their properties and possessions and divided them to all, as anyone had need.

Ac 2:46And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart,

Ac 2:47Praising God and having grace with all the people. And the Lord added together day by day those who were being saved.
